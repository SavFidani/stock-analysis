# stock-analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project was to provide an efficient analysis and comparison of the performances of a set list of stocks from 2017 to 2018. The value of this analysis was to provide data with the intention of guidance and advice for investing decisions. 

## Results

### Data Results

When analyzing the output generated by our Macros, we will see that only 2 stocks presented positive returns Y-o-Y. Those two stocks are ENPH and RUN. Although 2017 provides a very optimistic outlook for all of our investment options, we can see that drastically changes in 2018 where only the two previously mentioned stocks still present as favourable investment vehicles. 

To conclude, amongst these options of investments ENPH and RUN are the only two that should currently be advised as wise investment decisions.

### Execution Time

By refactoring our code from this module, I was able to make the macro run quicker. The below image demonstrates confirmation that when running our 2017 analysis execution time was a mere ~0.1484 seconds:

The below image also demonstrated analysis execution time of ~0.1328 seconds for 2018:

## Summary
### 1. What are advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?

Refactoring code presents two primary advantages: simplification and efficiency. By refactoring code, we are able to condense the amount of content actually being used to make our macro work. This results in less reading, and an ease of understanding can be attained when there is less code to work through. This simplification can allow for easier collaboration or an ease of resuming work if time has passed since the code was last analyzed. This simplification, by extension, leads to a higher level of efficiency. There is less code for our systems to work through which means our requests can be executed much quicker. 

Refactoring code does not come with its disadvantages. When you already have a working code, fine tuning requires a fine eye to detail. It can be very easy to make a typo - as I did several times in the process of getting this code to run - which then requires you to carefully back track your steps and see where the mistake was made. 

### 2. How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?

When refactoring the original VBA script, I was able to gain a better understanding of every aspects purpose as well as remove some of the "fluff". By doing so my results were presented quicker.

As mentioned, refactoring the code took a fine attention to detail which at times lead to frustration when certain components would stop working, and you have to take the time to solve the puzzle as to why that's the case.
